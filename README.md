# InternetSpeedTwitterBot
The code demonstrates a bot that measures internet speed using the Speedtest website and tweets a complaint to the internet service provider if the actual speed falls short of the promised speed.
# What I have learned
Throughout this project, I learned several key concepts:

Interacting with websites using Selenium: I gained experience in using Selenium to automate interactions with websites. This included tasks such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and extracting data from web pages.

Web scraping: I explored the technique of web scraping, which involved locating specific elements on a website using XPath and CSS selectors. This allowed me to extract the desired information from the web pages.

Using environment variables: I discovered the importance of using environment variables to store sensitive information. By avoiding hardcoding credentials and driver paths in my code, I enhanced the security of my project.

Automating Twitter interactions: I successfully automated various actions on Twitter using Selenium. This included tasks such as logging in, composing tweets, and clicking buttons programmatically.

Error handling: I encountered and dealt with errors, such as handling exceptions when elements were not found. I also employed techniques like waiting for elements to become clickable or visible before performing actions.

In summary, this project provided me with hands-on experience in web automation, web scraping, and utilizing environment variables. Through building a bot that performed specific tasks on websites, I gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of these techniques.
